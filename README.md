# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Feature-Selection-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This project explores an IBM telecom dataset, conducting initial EDA and data preprocessing. It examines three genetic algorithm variations for feature selection: one-point, two-point, and uniform crossover. Logistic regression is used to predict customer churn, and performance is evaluated using error bar plots.
